For example, we could start by calculating how many apples Lisa has after giving some away, and then add the number of apples she bought to that total.\\n\\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\\nSimilar to the previous module, breaking down the problem into smaller parts can make it easier to solve. We could break this problem down into two smaller problems: first, calculating how many apples Lisa has after giving some away, and second, calculating how many apples she has after buying more.\\n\\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\\nIn this case, the core issue is simply calculating how many apples Lisa has now, based on the number she started with, the number she gave away, and the number she bought.\\n\\n22. What resources (financial, human, technological, etc.) are needed to tackle the problem effectively?\\nWhile this module may not be strictly necessary for this problem, it is worth noting that in order to solve this problem, we need some basic arithmetic skills and the ability to add and subtract whole numbers.\\n\\n28. Is the problem an analytical one that requires data analysis, modeling, or optimization techniques?\\nAgain, this module may not be necessary for this particular problem, but it is worth noting that this problem does require some analytical thinking and the ability to manipulate numerical data.\\n\\nBased on these modules, we can solve the problem as follows:\\n\\n1. Lisa starts with 10 apples.\\n2. She gives away 3 apples, leaving her with 10 - 3 = 7 apples.\\n3.

She gives 3 apples to her friend and then buys 5 more apples from the store. How many apples does Lisa have now?', 'selected_modules': \" Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the problem you've provided, here are some reasoning modules that could be useful in solving it:\\n\\n4. How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?\\nThis module could be helpful in breaking down the problem into simpler steps. For example, we could start by calculating how many apples Lisa has after giving some away, and then add the number of apples she bought to that total.\\n\\n9. How can I break down this problem into smaller, more manageable parts?\\nSimilar to the previous module, breaking down the problem into smaller parts can make it easier to solve. We could break this problem down into two smaller problems: first, calculating how many apples Lisa has after giving some away, and second, calculating how many apples she has after buying more.\\n\\n16. What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?\\nIn this case, the core issue is simply calculating how many apples Lisa has now, based on the number she started with, the number she gave away, and the number she bought.\\n\\n22. What resources (financial, human, technological, etc.) are needed to tackle the problem effectively?\\nWhile this module may not be strictly necessary for this problem, it is worth noting that in order to solve this problem, we need some basic arithmetic skills and the ability to add and subtract whole numbers.\\n\\n28. Is the problem an analytical one that requires data analysis, modeling, or optimization techniques?\\nAgain, this module may not be necessary for this particular problem, but it is worth noting that this problem does require some analytical thinking and the ability to manipulate numerical data.\\n\\nBased on these modules, we can solve the problem as follows:\\n\\n1. Lisa starts with 10 apples.\\n2. She gives away 3 apples, leaving her with 10 - 3 = 7 apples.\\n3. She then buys 5 more apples, bringing her total to 7 + 5 = 12 apples.\\n\\nTherefore, Lisa has 12 apples now.\", 'adapted_modules': ' 1. Problem Decomposition: Break down the problem into simpler steps. First, calculate the number of apples Lisa has after giving some away (10 - 3 = 7 apples). Then, calculate the number of apples she has after buying more (7 + 5 = 12 apples).\\n2. Simplification: Simplify the problem by focusing on the arithmetic operations needed. Lisa has to subtract the number of apples she gave away and add the number of apples she bought.\\n3. Core Issue Identification: The core issue is to find the total number of apples Lisa has now, after giving some away and buying more.\\n4. Resource Allocation: No specific resources are required to solve this problem, just basic arithmetic skills.\\n5. Analytical Thinking: Apply analytical thinking to the problem by examining the given information and determining the sequence of arithmetic operations needed.\\n6. Data Manipulation: Manipulate the numerical data by performing the required arithmetic operations: subtraction and addition.\\n7. Problem Categorization: This problem is a simple arithmetic problem that requires adding and subtracting whole numbers.\\n\\nUsing these adapted reasoning modules, the solution to the problem can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n1. Lisa starts with 10 apples.\\n2. She gives away 3 apples, leaving her with 7 apples.\\n3.
