    "#### Reasoning without Observation\n",
    "\n",
    "ReWOO proposes an agent that combines a multi-step planner and variable substitution for effective tool use. It was designed to improve the ReACT-style agent architecture in the following ways:\n",
    "- Reduce token consumption and execution time by generating the full chain of tools used in a single pass.\n",
    "- Simplify the fine-tuning process. Since the planning doesn't depend on the outputs of the tool, models can be fine-tuned without actually involving the tools(in theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "ReWOO is made of 3 modules:\n",
    "1. Planner: GEnrate the plan in the format of: plan / reason, tool\n",
    "2. Worker: execute the tool with the provided arguments\n",
    "3. Solver: generates the answer for the initial task based on the tool observations.\n"
