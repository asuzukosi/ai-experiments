Under Napoleon III, who had been impressed by London’s parks while living in Britain, two ancient royal military preserves at the approaches to Paris were made into “English” parks—the Bois de Boulogne to the west and the Bois de Vincennes to the east. At its centre is the Île de la Cité, which is the seat of religious and temporal authority (the word cité connotes the nucleus of the ancient city). The surrounding heights have elevations that vary from 430 feet (130 meters), at the butte of Montmartre in the north, to 85 feet (26 meters), in the Grenelle area in the southwest.\\'}, {\\'url\\': \\'https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/02/17/mysterious-architecture-of-historical-towers/\\', \\'content\\': \\'By Eleni Philippou February 17, 2024 February 15, 2024 0 0 Share 0 The water towers of Cyprus, France and the Netherlands are the focal point of a new photography exhibition opening in Limassol.\\'}, {\\'url\\': \\'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris\\', \\'content\\': \\'The city\\\\\\'s population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\\\\nParis is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the agglomération Parisienne, and statistically as a unité urbaine (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration\\\\\\'s population of 10,785,092 in 2017[161] made it the largest urban area in the European Union.[162] City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical aire d\\\\\\'attraction de Paris (\"functional area\", a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area[163]), that had a population of 13,024,518 in 2017,[164] 19.6% of the population of France,[165] and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.[162]\\\\nAccording to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars,[232] anParis became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[233]\\\\nParis is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[232] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[234]\\\\nImmediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, including the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. After seizing power in Paris on 28\\\\xa0March, a revolutionary government known as the Paris Commune held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the \"Bloody Week\" at the end of May 1871.[59]\\\\nIn the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the 1900 Universal Exposition gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line.[60] Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (Émile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).[61]\\\\n20th and 21st centuries[edit]\\\\nBy 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.[62] In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of Paris, 1.5 million Muslims in the Île-de-France region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in France.[176][177]\\\\nThe Jewish population of the Paris Region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.[178]\\\\nEconomy[edit]\\\\nThe economy of the City of Paris is based largely on services and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry.[182] The Paris region\\\\\\'s most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La Défense business district places Paris\\\\\\'s economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the Opéra Garnier, La Défense and the Val de Seine.[194] While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and \"eco\" industries.[194]\\\\nIn the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.[195]\\'}, {\\'url\\':

Another key development â€“ and one thatâ€™s been a direct result of the pandemic â€“ is that the cafÃ©s, bars and restaurants have been allowed to spread out onto the sidewalks, and even into the streets themselves, giving the city a very different feel.\\\\n The city has already engaged in a huge transformation to meet these expectations: more spaces dedicated to pedestrians and sustainable mobility; significant greening of streets and rooftops; and thatâ€™s not to mention the commitment of hotels and chefs to a sustainable food supply. For a start, as well as adding some 50km of new cycle lanes across the city â€“ a project already under way but accelerated by the pandemic â€“ Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has also surged forward with her plans to reduce the amount of traffic. Â© PCA-STREAM\\\\nLooking ahead, the famed Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es is set to be transformed over the next decade or so into an â€œextraordinary gardenâ€�, with space for vehicles reduced by half, while the area around the Eiffel Tower is itself currently undergoing a green makeover.\\'}, {\\'url\\': \\'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris\\', \\'content\\': \\'The city\\\\\\'s population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\\\\nParis is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the agglomération Parisienne, and statistically as a unité urbaine (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration\\\\\\'s population of 10,785,092 in 2017[161] made it the largest urban area in the European Union.[162] City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical aire d\\\\\\'attraction de Paris (\"functional area\", a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area[163]), that had a population of 13,024,518 in 2017,[164] 19.6% of the population of France,[165] and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.[162]\\\\nAccording to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars,[232] anParis became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[233]\\\\nParis is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[232] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[234]\\\\nImmediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, including the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. After seizing power in Paris on 28\\\\xa0March, a revolutionary government known as the Paris Commune held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the \"Bloody Week\" at the end of May 1871.[59]\\\\nIn the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the 1900 Universal Exposition gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line.[60] Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (Émile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).[61]\\\\n20th and 21st centuries[edit]\\\\nBy 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.[62] In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of Paris, 1.5 million Muslims in the Île-de-France region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in France.[176][177]\\\\nThe Jewish population of the Paris Region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.[178]\\\\nEconomy[edit]\\\\nThe economy of the City of Paris is based largely on services and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry.[182] The Paris region\\\\\\'s most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La Défense business district places Paris\\\\\\'s economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the Opéra Garnier, La Défense and the Val de Seine.[194] While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and \"eco\" industries.[194]\\\\nIn the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.[195]\\'}]', name='tavily_search_results_json')]}\n",

Under Napoleon III, who had been impressed by London’s parks while living in Britain, two ancient royal military preserves at the approaches to Paris were made into “English” parks—the Bois de Boulogne to the west and the Bois de Vincennes to the east. At its centre is the Île de la Cité, which is the seat of religious and temporal authority (the word cité connotes the nucleus of the ancient city).

Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars,[232] anParis became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[233]\\\\nParis is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[232] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[234]\\\\nImmediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, including the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. After seizing power in Paris on 28\\\\xa0March, a revolutionary government known as the Paris Commune held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the \"Bloody Week\" at the end of May 1871.[59]\\\\nIn the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the 1900 Universal Exposition gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line.[60] Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (Émile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).[61]\\\\n20th and 21st centuries[edit]\\\\nBy 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.[62] In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of Paris, 1.5 million Muslims in the Île-de-France region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in France.[176][177]\\\\nThe Jewish population of the Paris Region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.[178]\\\\nEconomy[edit]\\\\nThe economy of the City of Paris is based largely on services and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry.[182] The Paris region\\\\\\'s most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La Défense business district places Paris\\\\\\'s economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the Opéra Garnier, La Défense and the Val de Seine.[194] While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and \"eco\" industries.[194]\\\\nIn the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.[195]\\'}, {\\'url\\':

Another key development â€“ and one thatâ€™s been a direct result of the pandemic â€“ is that the cafÃ©s, bars and restaurants have been allowed to spread out onto the sidewalks, and even into the streets themselves, giving the city a very different feel.\\\\n The city has already engaged in a huge transformation to meet these expectations: more spaces dedicated to pedestrians and sustainable mobility; significant greening of streets and rooftops; and thatâ€™s not to mention the commitment of hotels and chefs to a sustainable food supply. For a start, as well as adding some 50km of new cycle lanes across the city â€“ a project already under way but accelerated by the pandemic â€“ Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has also surged forward with her plans to reduce the amount of traffic. Â© PCA-STREAM\\\\nLooking ahead, the famed Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es is set to be transformed over the next decade or so into an â€œextraordinary gardenâ€�, with space for vehicles reduced by half, while the area around the Eiffel Tower is itself currently undergoing a green makeover.\\'}, {\\'url\\': \\'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris\\', \\'content\\': \\'The city\\\\\\'s population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\\\\nParis is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the agglomération Parisienne, and statistically as a unité urbaine (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration\\\\\\'s population of 10,785,092 in 2017[161] made it the largest urban area in the European Union.[162] City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical aire d\\\\\\'attraction de Paris (\"functional area\", a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area[163]), that had a population of 13,024,518 in 2017,[164] 19.6% of the population of France,[165] and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.[162]\\\\nAccording to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars,[232] anParis became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[233]\\\\nParis is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[232] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[234]\\\\nImmediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, including the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. After seizing power in Paris on 28\\\\xa0March, a revolutionary government known as the Paris Commune held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the \"Bloody Week\" at the end of May 1871.[59]\\\\nIn the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the 1900 Universal Exposition gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line.[60] Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (Émile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).[61]\\\\n20th and 21st centuries[edit]\\\\nBy 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.[62] In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of Paris, 1.5 million Muslims in the Île-de-France region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in France.[176][177]\\\\nThe Jewish population of the Paris Region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.[178]\\\\nEconomy[edit]\\\\nThe economy of the City of Paris is based largely on services and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry.[182] The Paris region\\\\\\'s most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La Défense business district places Paris\\\\\\'s economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the Opéra Garnier, La Défense and the Val de Seine.[194] While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and \"eco\" industries.[194]\\\\nIn the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.[195]\\'}]', name='tavily_search_results_json'), HumanMessage(content='', name='Researcher'), HumanMessage(content='', name='Chart Generator')], 'sender': 'Chart Generator'}\n",
