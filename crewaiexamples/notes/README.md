#### Notes on CrewAI

CrewAI has been getting a lot of attention, its time to dive deep and start contributing to the project and see what I can learn, since the author of the project is pushing it agressively online. 

Cutting-edge framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. By fostering collaborative intelligence, CrewAI empowers agents to work together seamlessly, tackling complex tasks.
